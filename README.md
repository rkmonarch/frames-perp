## Ferps
Ferps is a simple way to interact with Farcaster frames and start trading in crypto by just clicking one button. It uses biconomy smart contract wallet and Fetcch for requestig amount to deposit in the newly created wallet. It uses neynar APIs for casting new cast for users as a notification for depositing amount in the SCW.
